- 👋 Hi, I’m Elias Rahmani
- 👀 I’m interested in developing high quality distributed softwares. My main expertise are in Backend engineering including:
   -  API and endpoint development
   -  Batch processing 🔡 for data integration
   -  Microservices architecture 🧬
   -  System design 🩹
- ❕ Besides software engineering, I am also interested in Linux, virtualization, and clouds.
- 🃏 I have a friend who believes programming in VIM doesn't make you a better software engineer and I'd say so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Genarative AI and multidimentional vector spaces.
- 💻 I’m working as a full time employee but open to open-source contribution.
